      <description>Words Dear Bloggers:
Today I come write to you in the spirit of rebellion as I declare my unbridled desire to experience the English language at its fullest.
Last week my dear friend Will Qualls (@WKQualls) sent out a tweet asking about how important grammar and convention is to bloggers. Will has a special talent for getting people thinking and my thoughts on this topic can’t be contained to the limitations of twitter.</description>

      <description>In Defense of “Guys” Come along with me stumpers, as I take a nerdy deep dive into the intersection of regional identity, feminism and language.
First off I am going to reveal one of my thinly veiled secrets. I am from the Pacific Northwest (PNW). My whole family is from the Pacific Northwest. My family roots in the PNW go back four generations. If you look at the population trends for the Northwestern States, the growth, powered by transplants from other states has been explosive over the course of my lifetime.</description>

      <description>Owning Sex Dear Stumpers:
This past week, I received my first feedback from a self described, lifestyle kinkster, about the #cyberslut. I admit, I went out on a limb and inserted myself into their conversation, hoping to reach out to new audiences and expand my reach. This feedback described some of my assertions as inaccurate fundamentally wrong. I asked them to share resources on the topics but they did not respond.</description>

      <description>Twitter Brain Twitter Brain; Noun:
 The condition resulting from excessive attention to Twitter characterized by intense effort toward building your personal brand and attracting new followers. A person who thinks too much about their Twitter following.  Example: Stump Mom’s writing and research and overall attention were suffering because she had Twitter Brain.
I have recently come to terms with a reality that much America has been living with or some time - It doesn’t take much to come down with a case of Twitter Brain.</description>

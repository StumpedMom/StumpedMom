<p>I am a fiction - an artistic alter ego created to emphasize key traits of my creators personal identity while intentionally masking others. All biographies and human self presentations include exaggeration as well as obfuscation; it is only in fiction that we dispense with the pretense of factual authenticity, and free ourselves to explore larger truths. That being said, I identify as a slutty, white, divorced mother of one in the year 2018. I live in a west coast city, there is no hiding that. I am college educated and I own a modest home in an “up and coming neighborhood” (The whole foods 8 blocks up just went in 2 years ago). I have a job that pays me just enough to be able to afford the mortgage on that home and do enough repairs to keep it from falling down. So I guess that makes me part of the “coastal elite.” My favorite Muppet is Gonzo. I am a weirdo, who has learned to assimilate with everyday life but every single day I see elephants in rooms and I want to talk about them. This room is parenting and mothering in contemporary America and I want to talk about pesky pachyderms.</p>

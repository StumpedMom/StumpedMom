## The Tweet That Launched at Least One Complaint

Dear Stumpers, 

<img src = "../../../../images/this_is_me1.png" style="width:300px;float:left;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-right: 15px;">I have been surprised and deeply touched by your positive responses to my triumphant blogging. People have saluted my bravery and encouraged me to write more.  Many readers have asked me, “What was the tweet that got you fired? What was going on in your office?” Did I say many? I meant two people have asked me about the tweet, but that extrapolates to half of my readership! 

The thirst of the people must be slaked. I shall recreate the tweet. 

The  exact verbiage of the offending tweet was lost to me when I deleted the original Stumped Mom twitter account in a fit of panic. It likely survives in paper form in my Employee Record file in a locked filing cabinet, in a locked office, behind my old bosses desk. There it will remain for five more years to protect the organization from potential litigation and to hold over me.  I am not going back there to get it! 

Rather, I shall do my best to recreate it.  If I’m a cyberslut qween then context is king! To create context, have nested the tweet in a timeline of fictionalized workplace quotes. The quotes, times and dates have been resumed from a graveyard of my personal regrets. Then reassembled using my faulty,  parenting, concussion, and PTSD addled memory. Timeline and verbiage have been approximated, the names have been changed. Consider me a completely unreliable but occasionally entertaining narrator.

In my first week of work I received an ominous warning from a gal that’s always had other women’s backs.

Barb rounded up all of the women under the age of fifty and spoke to us one by one about the way we were dressing at work. I was wearing khakis and a solid green, Old Navy v-neck t-shirt on a casual Friday. 
“It’s not just you, I’m talking to all of the young women in the office, today. I’d like to see...less cleavage, like that top you’re wearing today, I can see how you might think that’s appropriate but our industry is very conservative. Some of the men, I’m not saying who, but at least one has complained that he is uncomfortable.”

## About me:

Hi I’m Robin and Stumped Mom and I used to be a  poorly kept secret. I like to write confessional, satirical essays and I enjoy sharing them with people, hearing their feedback and getting to know more about life in the process. I wanted to be able to be myself, write real and avoid the consequences. So my blog used to be anonymous, but then I crashed it into my life. So I killed Stumped Mom, but after two years in the literary desert I have brought her back and she’s bringing me with her. 
I find doing this work on an open forum empowering and healing. Confessional essay blogs are an artform that excels in supply but lags in demand. So if you’re here reading this. Thank you!
